      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today speaker assistants such as Cortana, Google, Siri are used in our mobile phones as a resource that we use in our daily life and that we can inter actuate with them. and one of the main engine oh those kind of technologies are the way to identify the speaker in real-time.  Thus, we are going to focus in the aim of identifying the speaker from a single audio information using machine learning techniques, although this work involves hard and advance task in computer science the scientists were working on this problems for a long time until our life, but we still need a new approaches to identify, tackling problems from audio retrieval from real scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
