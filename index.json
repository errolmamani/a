He is doing his research in the field of Natural Language Processing using novel Deep learning techniques to identify any kind of aggressive or offensive content. He also works in cooperation with other students in Peru to push up the research not only in text analysis if not in audio and image which involve the wide field of NLP. His interests are focused on: aggressive, offensive language detection, text generation, speaker recognition, optical character recognition, sentiment analysis.
